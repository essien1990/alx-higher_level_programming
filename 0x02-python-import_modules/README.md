# ALX SE Python Programming - 0x02. Python - import & modules


* Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3
  
* Write a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, does some Maths, and prints the result.

* Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.
  * The output should be:
          - Number of argument(s) followed by argument (if number is one) or arguments (otherwise), followed by
          - : (or . if no arguments were passed) followed by a new line, followed by (if at least one argument),
  * one line per argument:
          - the position of the argument (starting at 1) followed by :, followed by the argument value and a new line

* Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.
      - The output should be the result of the addition of all arguments, followed by a new line
      - You can cast arguments into integers by using int() (you can assume that all arguments can be casted into integers)
      - Your code should not be executed when imported

* Write a program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc [please download it locally](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x02.py/raw/master/hidden_4.pyc).

* Write a program that imports the variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value.

* Write a program that imports all functions from the file calculator_1.py and handles basic operations.

* Write a program that prints #pythoniscool, followed by a new line, in the standard output.

* Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b).

* Write a program that prints the alphabet in uppercase, followed by a new line.
